## Title
Silent overflow could alter computation when calculating the vaultPortion in the PrizePool contract

## Impact
- If an overflow happens, the computed value of the vault portion will be a totally different value than what should really be, which would end up causing the rewards to disburse to be lower for the draw that was used to compute the vault portion.

### Note: 
Even though [the bot reported issues about downcasting variables](https://gist.github.com/itsmetechjay/e7fd03943bbacff1984a33b9f89c4149#low-4-use-safecast-to-safely-downcast-variables), it didn't mention this specific unsafe casting, which if an overflow occurs could cause a huge impact on the calculation of the vault portions.

## Proof of Concept
- When computing the vaultPortion to the PrizePool over a specific duration in draw, the values of the [`vaultContributed`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-prize-pool/blob/4bc8a12b857856828c018510b5500d722b79ca3a/src/PrizePool.sol#L963-L968) & [`totalContributed`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-prize-pool/blob/4bc8a12b857856828c018510b5500d722b79ca3a/src/PrizePool.sol#L951-L956) variables are computed on the DrawAccumulatorLib library, and [they are computed and returned as `uint256` values.](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-prize-pool/blob/4bc8a12b857856828c018510b5500d722b79ca3a/src/libraries/DrawAccumulatorLib.sol#L166-L307)

- The issue is that in the `PrizePool::_getVaultPortion()` the `vaultContributed` & `totalContributed` variables are unsafely casted from uint256 to int256, which could lead to a silent overflow if any of the two original values don't fit on an `int256`
  - As a result of a silent overflow, the computed value of the vault portion will be a totally different value than what should really be, which would end up causing the rewards to disburse to be lower for the draw that was used to compute the vault portion.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Make sure to implement a safe cast that checks if overflows occur to prevent computing a totally different value than what it should really be.
  - Use OZ safeCast library for this type of operation.
