## Title
Attacker can DoS deposits to a new Vault


## Impact
Attackers can DoS deposits on New Vaults, rendering the vault completely unnusable.

## Proof of Concept
When doing a deposit on a Vault, [there are some checks that analyze the state of the Rebase values](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-bakerfi/blob/main/contracts/core/Vault.sol#L204-L209). Deposits are allowed only when `(total.elastic == 0 && total.base == 0)` || `(total.base > 0 && total.elastic > 0)`, any other combination of those two values will cause the deposit to revert.

```
function deposit(
    address receiver
)
    ...
{
    ...

    Rebase memory total = Rebase(_totalAssets(maxPriceAge), totalSupply());
    if (
        // Or the Rebase is unititialized
        !((total.elastic == 0 && total.base == 0) ||
            // Or Both are positive
            (total.base > 0 && total.elastic > 0))
    ) revert InvalidAssetsState();
    ...
}
```

The `total.elastic` represents the [assets controlled by the Vault in the associated Strategy](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-bakerfi/blob/main/contracts/core/Vault.sol#L289-L291).
- The assets controlled by the Vault is the difference between the value in ETH of the aCollateralTokens owned by the Strategy and the total WETH debt of the Strategy.

The `total.base` represents all the vault shares that have been minted (totalSupply())

An attacker can donate (do a direct transfer) 1 wei of the aCollateralToken to the Strategy. This will make the `total.elastic` to be equals to 1 wei, while the `total.base` is 0 because any deposits on the Vault have been made.
- `total.elastic > 0 && total.base == 0` is a combination of values that will cause a deposit to revert with the error `InvalidAssetsState`

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Remove those if conditionals from the deposit(). Design a different mechanism to validate the state of the Rebase that can't be affected by direct donations of aCollateralTokens
