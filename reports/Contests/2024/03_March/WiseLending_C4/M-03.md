# Medium Severity

## Title
Exiting a farm on mainnet assumes a peg of 1:1  when swapping stETH for ETH 

## Impact
When stETH depegs from ETH, the swaps on Curve will revert due to requesting a higher amountOut than what the curves pool will give.

## Proof of Concept
When exiting a farm on mainnet, the requested tokensOut is set as `stETH` for redeeming the SY tokens on the PENDLE_SY contract. Once the PowerFarm has on its balance the `stETH` tokens, [it does a swap from stETH to ETH using the Curves protocol.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-wise-lending/blob/main/contracts/PowerFarms/PendlePowerFarm/PendlePowerFarmLeverageLogic.sol#L293-L308)

The problem is that the implementation is assuming a peg of 1 ETH ~= 1 stETH. Even though both tokens have a tendency to keep the peg, this hasn't been always the case as it can be seen [in this dashboard](https://dune.com/LidoAnalytical/Curve-ETHstETH). There have been many episodes of market volatility that affected the price of stETH, notably the one in last June when stETH traded at ~0.93 ETH.

[When computing the `_minOutAmount`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-wise-lending/blob/main/contracts/PowerFarms/PendlePowerFarm/PendlePowerFarmLeverageLogic.sol#L194-L199), the PowerFarm calculates the ethValue of the received stETH tokens by requesting the price of the `WETH` asset, and then it applies the reverAllowedSpread to finally determine the `_minOutAmount` of ETH tokens that will be accepted from the swap on Curves
- The WETH price is pegged 1:1 to ETH, 1 WETH will always be 1 ETH, but, using the price of WETH to determine the `minOutAmount` is problematic, because, as seen in the dashboard, historically, `1 stETH has deppeged from 1:1 from ETH`
  - Example: Assume a user sets a slippage of 1%. If stETH were to depeg to 0.95 per ETH, when swapping it would try to make sure that the user received at least 0.99 ETH. Whenever trying to swap it will revert because curves can't give the requested `minOutAmount` of ETH tokens, it could give at most 0.95 ETH per stETH.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
The recommendation would be to implement a mitigation similar to the one implemented on the referenced issues.
Basically, fetch the current price of `stETH` from a Chainlink Oracle and multiply the `minOutAmount` by the current price of `stETH`. In this way, the `minOutAmount` that is sent to the Curves exchange will now be within the correct limits based on the current price of stETH.
- Also, make sure to multiply the `ethValueBefore` by the current price of stETH (Only when exiting farms on mainnet). In this way, both amounts, `ethValueAfter` and `ethValueBefore` will be computed based on the current price of stETH, allowing the slippage to validate that no ethValue was lost during the process of removing liquidity from pendle, redeeming the sy tokens and swapping on curves. In the end, both, `ethValueAfter` and `ethValueBefore` will represent the ethValue based on the stETH price.
