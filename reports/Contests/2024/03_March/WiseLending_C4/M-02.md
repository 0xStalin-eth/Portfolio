# Medium Severity

## Title
Withdrawing uncollateralized deposits is possible even though the position is in liquidation mode

## Impact
Users can withdraw uncollateralized deposits even though their position is liquidable, [as opposed to the README](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-wise-lending/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L137), if the position is in liquidation mode, users should use their uncollateralized deposits to avoid liquidation instead of removing them

## Proof of Concept
When withdrawing deposits from public pools, at the end of the tx is executed the [`WiseLending._healthStateCheck() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-wise-lending/blob/main/contracts/WiseLending.sol#L77-L90), which depending on the value of the `powerFarmCheck` will determine if the position's collateral is enough to cover the borrows.
  - If `powerFarmCheck` is true, it will use the `bare` value of the collateral, meaning, the `collateralFactor` is not applied to the collateral's value
  - If `powerFarmCheck` is false, it will use the `weighted` value of the collateral, meaning, the `collateralFactor` is applied to the collateral's value.

When withdrawing an uncollateralized deposit, the [`WiseCore._coreWithdrawToken() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-wise-lending/blob/main/contracts/WiseCore.sol#L44-L100) calls the [`WiseSecurity.checksWithdraw() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-wise-lending/blob/main/contracts/WiseSecurity/WiseSecurity.sol#L237-L270) to determine the value of the `powerFarmCheck`, if the pool from where the tokens are being withdrawn is uncollateralized, the `powerFarmCheck` will be set to `true`, which will cause that the [`WiseLending._healthStateCheck() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-wise-lending/blob/main/contracts/WiseLending.sol#L77-L90) uses the `bare` value of the full collateral to determine if the collateral can cover the existing borrows. 
- **Using the bare value of the collateral does not accurately reflect if a position is liquidable or not**, the liquidation's logic in the [`WiseSecurity.checksLiquidation() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-wise-lending/blob/main/contracts/WiseSecurity/WiseSecurity.sol#L105-L137) uses the `weightedCollateral` instead of the `bareCollateral` to determine if the position is liquidable or not. So, this difference to determine if the position's collateral can cover the borrows when withdrawing uncollateralized deposits and when doing liquidation causes a discrepancy to allow the withdrawal of uncollateralized deposits even though the position is in liquidation mode.


For example, a user requests a withdrawal of an uncollateralized deposit in a position with the below values:
- 1.5e18 ETH of `bare collateral`
- 1.2e18 ETH of `weightedCollateral`
- 1.3e18 ETH of `borrows`
  - The withdrawal will be allowed even though the position is in liquidation mode. Because of the `powerFarmCheck` being set to `true`, the [`WiseLending._healthStateCheck() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-wise-lending/blob/main/contracts/WiseLending.sol#L77-L90) will check if 95% of the bareCollateral can cover the borrows, 95% of 1.5e18 ETH would be 1.425e18 ETH, thus, the withdrawal will be possible, even though the position is in liquidation mode.

```
function checksWithdraw(
    ...
)
    ...
{
    ...

    if (_isUncollateralized(_nftId, _poolToken) == true) {
        return true;
    }

    ...
}

```

```
function _getState(
    uint256 _nftId,
    bool _powerFarm
)
    internal
    view
    returns (bool)
{
    ...

    //@audit-info => If `powerFarmCheck` is true, overalCollateral will be computed using the value of the `bareCollateral`
    //@audit-info => If `powerFarmCheck` is false, overalCollateral will be computed using the value of the `weightedCollateral`

    uint256 overallCollateral = _powerFarm == true
        ? overallETHCollateralsBare(_nftId)
        : overallETHCollateralsWeighted(_nftId);

    //@audit-info => If 95% of the overalCollateral > borrowAmount, withdrawal will be allowed!
    return overallCollateral
        * BORROW_PERCENTAGE_CAP
        / PRECISION_FACTOR_E18
        < borrowAmount;
}
```

  - Now, when using the same values but for a liquidation, we have that the `weightedCollateral` is not enough to cover the borros, thus, the position is liquidable.

> WiseSecurity.sol
```
function checksLiquidation(
    ...
)
    external
    view
{
    ...

    //@audit-info => When doing liquidations, the value of the `weightedCollateral` is used to determine if the position is liquidable or not!
    canLiquidate(
        borrowETHTotal,
        weightedCollateralETH
    );

    ...
}
```

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
If the protocol wants to enforce that users use their uncollateralized deposits to avoid liquidations when the positions are liquidable, don't set to `true` the `powerFarmCheck` when doing withdrawals for uncollateralized deposits. Allow the [`WiseLending._healthStateCheck() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-wise-lending/blob/main/contracts/WiseLending.sol#L77-L90) to validate if the position is indeed in liquidation mode by using the `weightedCollateral` instead of the `bareCollateral` value.
