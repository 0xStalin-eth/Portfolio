## Title
SellingCredit can incorrectly reverts because `params.amount` is incorrectly threated as if it would represent `credit`, when in reality could represent `cash` and the credit been sold would be grather than minimumCreditBorrowAToken

## Impact
CreditSellers can errounously get their market orders reverted because an incorrect validation that assumes `params.amount` represents credit when in reality it could represent an amount of cash to be sold

## Proof of Concept
When selling credit using a Market Order, the CreditSellers have two combinations for the cash and credit they'd like to sell/receive:
1. Sell an specific amount of credit for whatever amount of cash they could get. [`params.exactAmountIn == true`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/SellCreditMarket.sol#L159-L167)
2. Receive an specific amount of cash for whatever amount of credit they'll need to pay. [`params.exactAmountIn == false`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/SellCreditMarket.sol#L168-L182)

There is a problem that can cause CreditSellers when selling specific amounts of cash that can cause tx to be reverted when they should not revert. 
The problem is caused due to the [`validateSellCreditMarket() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/SellCreditMarket.sol#L51-L122) incorrectly assuming that `params.amount` always represents Credit.
- This function enforces that [`params.amount` is above the `minimumCreditBorrowAToken`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/SellCreditMarket.sol#L93-L95), or in other words, there is a check to enforce CreditSellers can only sell credit above the minimum allowed amount to sell.

For example, if `minimumCreditBorrowAToken` is set to 100 Credit, and, a CreditSeller would like to sell 100 cash for 1 year to a CreditBuyer who set an APR of 30%, **those 100 cash would in reality be a credit of 130**, but, because the validation assumes `params.amount` is credit, the market order of the CreditSeller won't be executed, even though, the amount of credit that would be sold is clearly above the minimum.

```
function validateSellCreditMarket(State storage state, SellCreditMarketParams calldata params) external view {
    ...

    //@audit-issue => Assuming `params.amount` represents an amount of Credit to be sold
    //@audit-issue => `params.amount` can actually represent a specific amount of Cash the CreditSeller would like to receive for whatever required amount of Credit 
    // validate amount
    if (params.amount < state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken) {
        revert Errors.CREDIT_LOWER_THAN_MINIMUM_CREDIT(params.amount, state.riskConfig.minimumCreditBorrowAToken);
    }

    ...
}
```
 

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
I can think of two potential mitigations:
1. Add a minimum value of cash to be sold, and, check if `params.amount` represents credit or cash, and depending on what it represents, validate if it is above the corresponding minimum value.
2. Check if `params.amount` represents cash, if so, convert the requested amount of cash to be sold to the corresponding credit that would actually be sold, and use that amount of credit to validate if its above the `minimumCreditBorrowAToken` or not.
