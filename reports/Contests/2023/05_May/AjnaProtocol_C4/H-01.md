# High Severity
## Title
An Attacker can take all the rewards assigned to the RewardsManager by using fake pools by calling RewardsManager.updateBucketExchangeRatesAndClaim()

## Impact
An attacker can take all the rewards (AjnaTokens) assigned to the RewardsManager by calling the `updateBucketExchangeRatesAndClaim()` and passing a malitious contract as the parameter for the `pool_` parameter!

## Proof of Concept
When the function `updateBucketExchangeRatesAndClaim()` is called, **there is no check to enforce that only valid pools supported by the protocol can be used to** go through the process of **updating the rewards**, even though there are a number of requisites in order to make a successful attack, **all the internal calculations are dependent on data received from the `pool_` contract**, either to determine the execution path to follow or to update the RewardsManager contract's state.

Because of the short period the contest lasts, I didn't code a POC to create an attack, but I'm gonna point out how an attacker could abuse the lack of a check to validate that only valid pools can be used to update rewards.

The attacker will need to send two transactions, the first one will be to update the contract's state and assign a value to the [storage that is read by the `prevBucketExchangeRate`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L785) variable, so in the next transaction, this variable will be different than 0, and the next [if()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L789) statement can be bypassed, thus, proceeding to manipulate the `rewards_` that will be taken by the attacker.

The attacker will basically create and deploy malitious contracts implementing the required function that are called as part of the process to update the rewards, and these functions will return specific values that will end up bypassing the checks and setting the contract's storage in a vulnerable state allowing the attacker to get away with as much rewards as he could. In example, listing the functions that will need to be implemented are:
- [IPool(pool_).currentBurnEpoch();](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L779), the attacker can return any amount that will end up allowing him to continue with the attack.
- [IPool(pool_).burnInfo(currentBurnEventEpoch_);](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L645) & [IPool(pool_).burnInfo(lastBurnEventEpoch_);](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L651), again, the attacker just need to return values that will end up causing the contract's state to be vulnerable and allowing him to take all the rewards
- And finally, by [bypassing this check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L701-L730), the attacker has gainned access to set the rewards to claim

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Create a validation to verify that the `pool_` parameter received it is actually a real pool supported by the protocol, and if it is not a real pool, rever the transaction!
