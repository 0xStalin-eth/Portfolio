## Title
Not overriding maxWithdraw() on the Vault causes the function to not be EIP4626 compatible because it does not return the real amounts that can be withdrawn, fees are pending to be accounted

## Finding description and impact
### Impact
`Vault.maxWithdraw()` (which is the original function of the ERC4626Upgradeable contract) is not EIP4626 compatible because the Vault charges withdrawalFees that causes that the real withdrawable amount to be lower.

### Finding Description
The original `maxWithdraw()` from the ERC4626Upgradeable contract does not consider if the Vault charges withdrawalFees, as such, it simply returns the amount of assets that could be withdrawn with all the user's shares.
- The problem is that the [`Vault.withdraw()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/vault/ConcreteMultiStrategyVault.sol#L388-L406) charges the withdrawalFee as shares on top of the required shares to withdraw the specified amount of assets, **this amount won't be enough to process the withdrawal because the user won't have that many shares, which will cause the withdrawal tx to revert**, effectively violating the [EIP4626 standard which specifies that maxWithdraw: `MUST return the maximum amount of assets that could be transferred from owner through withdraw and not cause a revert`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#totalassets:~:text=MUST%20return%20the%20maximum%20amount%20of%20assets%20that%20could%20be%20transferred%20from%20owner%20through%20withdraw%20and%20not%20cause%20a%20revert)

```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint256 assets_,
    address receiver_,
    address owner_
) public override nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 shares) {
    ...

    // If msg.sender is the withdrawal queue, go straght to the actual withdrawal
    uint256 withdrawalFee = uint256(fees.withdrawalFee);
    uint256 feeShares = msg.sender != feeRecipient
        ? shares.mulDiv(MAX_BASIS_POINTS, MAX_BASIS_POINTS - withdrawalFee, Math.Rounding.Floor) - shares
        : 0;
    //@audit-info => feeShares are charged on top of the required shares to withdraw the specified amount!
    shares += feeShares;

    _withdraw(assets_, receiver_, owner_, shares, feeShares);
}
```

As demonstrated on the next PoC, a User with 10k shares calls `maxWithdraw()` to know how many assets can withdraw, and then, it attempts to withdraw the exact amount returned from the maxWithdraw(), but, the tx reverts, the reason is because the fees for the withdrawal are charged on top of the required shares to process the withdrawal, which means, the user would need to have more than 10k shares to be able to withdraw the requested 10k assets.

## Proof of Concept
Add the below PoC on the [`ConcreteMultiStrategyVault.t.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/test/ConcreteMultiStrategyVault.t.sol) test file.

> Run the PoC with the next command `forge test --match-test test_maxWithdrawNotEIP4626CompatiblePoC -vvvv`

```solidity
function test_maxWithdrawNotEIP4626CompatiblePoC() public {
    uint256 depositAmount = 10_000e18;
    asset.mint(hazel, type(uint256).max / 2);
    vm.startPrank(hazel);
    asset.approve(address(vault), type(uint256).max);
    vault.deposit(depositAmount, hazel);
    vm.stopPrank();

    uint256 maxWithdrawableAmount = vault.maxWithdraw(hazel);
    vm.prank(hazel);
    //@audit-info => Expected to revert because maxWithdraw() not returning the exact amount of assets that can be withdrawn because not accounting for withdrawalFees
    vm.expectRevert();
    vault.withdraw(maxWithdrawableAmount);
}
```

## Tools Used
Manual Audit, Foundry && [EIP4626 documentation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#totalassets:~:text=MUST%20return%20the%20maximum%20amount%20of%20assets%20that%20could%20be%20transferred%20from%20owner%20through%20withdraw%20and%20not%20cause%20a%20revert)

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Override the `maxWithdraw()` on the Vault contract and return the exact amount of assets that can be withdrawn with all the user's shares after discounting the withdrawalFee.
