## Title
Incorrectly calculation of the totalBadDebtUsd for an entire pool

## Impact
Incorrectly calculation of the totalBadDebtUsd for an entire pool.
Depending on the usage the protol has for this information it could disrupt core mechanisms or cause problems with the internal accounting

## Proof of Concept
Following the [math applied on the `ChainlinkOracle` contract of the Venus Protocol](https://github.com/VenusProtocol/oracle/blob/develop/contracts/oracles/ChainlinkOracle.sol#L147-L221), the **price is returned in the scale of 10 ^ (36 - underlying asset decimals))**

- The problem is **when there are underlying assets of different decimals in the same pool, the price will be scaled up by different powers depending on the number of decimals of the underlying assets**

**Example**
```
    WBNB (18 decimals in BSC).  USD price: $300.    Value returned by the Oracles:  300^1e18
    TRX (6 decimals in BSC).    USD price: $0.068.  Value returned by the Oracles:  0.068^1e30
```
- When adding the badDebt for the two markets, **the totalBadDebtUsd will be totally distorted because it will end up summing two values scaled up by different powers**, the real debt of those markets that is price is scaled up by a lower power than others it will be totally diminished by the difference in scales.
- The resultant totalBadDebtUsd won't represent accurately the real debt of the pool which could lead to a number of different issues depending on how the protocol relies on this value

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Make sure to divide the result of multiplying the `badDebt()` of the current market * the price of the underlyingasset by 10^18 to normalize the units before assigning the value of the `badDebtUsd`
- Take as example the [correct calculation of the usdValue of a marketDebt made on the Shortfall contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/main/contracts/Shortfall/Shortfall.sol#L393)
```solidity
badDebt.badDebtUsd =
  (VToken(address(markets[i])).badDebt() *
  priceOracle.getUnderlyingPrice(address(markets[i]))) / 1e18;
```
