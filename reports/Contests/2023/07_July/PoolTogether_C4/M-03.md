Duplicate of #300 == VaultFactory allows deployment of vaults with non-authentic TwabController and PrizePool

## Title
Malicious Vault's owners can set a malicious contract as the _yieldVault contract and steal all the user deposits

## Impact
- Malicious owners can steal all the funds deposited by users on PoolTogether vaults.

## Proof of Concept
- First of all, any vault that is listed in the `VaultFactory` contract will look like a real Pool Together vault, so, users can blindly believe that all Vaults listed in the `VaultFactory` are safe to interact with, when in reality, if a malicious vault owner/deployer set the `yieldVault` contract to an address of a malicious contract (as explained in the next paragraph), all users deposits can be stolen.

- Malicious vault owners can deploy a malicious contract faking all the function's signatures of the ERC4626 contract, but the logic on those functions can either be left unimplemented or altered so that all the deposited funds are transferred to an address that the vault creator controls.

- The [`VaultFactory` contract allows anybody to deploy permissionless new PoolTogether Vaults](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/VaultFactory.sol#L55-L78), the issue is that it [**allows the deployers to set the address of the `yieldVault` contract as any address they want to set.**](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/VaultFactory.sol#L60)
- The [`_yieldVault` address is then forwarded to the constructor of the Vault contract](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/VaultFactory.sol#L72), which means that [this new Vault contract will set the `yieldVault` contract as the address that was send by the vault creator](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L254-L272), and ultimately, [**all the user deposits in this PoolTogether vault will be forwarded to wathever address was set for the `yieldVault` variable**](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L959)

- Once the funds have reached the malicious `yieldVault` contract, the contract can either automatically redirect the funds to an address of the PoolTogether vault's owner, or it can be locked in the vault until the owner of this fake vault wants to claim all the stolen funds at once.


## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Since the `yieldVault` contract must be an ERC4626 compliant contract, instead of allowing vault's owners to set an arbitrary address as the YieldVault, better deploy a fresh 4626 contract during the construction of the PoolTogether's Vault.
  - In this way, the protocol enforces that the YieldVault will indeed be a 4626 contract and not an arbitrary contract that could contain malicious code that allows the vault's owners to get away with all the depositted underlying assets.

- Make the below code adjustments to the Vault's constructor:
```solidity
constructor(
    IERC20 asset_,
    string memory name_,
    string memory symbol_,
    TwabController twabController_,
-   IERC4626 yieldVault_,
    PrizePool prizePool_,
    address claimer_,
    address yieldFeeRecipient_,
    uint256 yieldFeePercentage_,
    address owner_
  ) ERC4626(asset_) ERC20(name_, symbol_) ERC20Permit(name_) Ownable(owner_) {
    ...
-   if (address(yieldVault_) == address(0)) revert YieldVaultZeroAddress();
    ...

-   _yieldVault = yieldVault_;
+   _yieldVault = new ERC4626(asset_);

    ...
    ...
  }

```
