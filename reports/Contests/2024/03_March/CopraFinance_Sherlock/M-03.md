# Title
Impossible to execute whitelisted actions and send the native token within the same execution.

## Summary
Impossible to execute whitelisted actions that require to send the native token.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [`LiquidityWarehouse.execute() function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-copra-finance-stalinMacias/blob/main/copra-v3-audit-1/src/LiquidityWarehouse.sol#L248-L254) internally calls the [`LiquidityWarehouseAccessControl._execute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-copra-finance-stalinMacias/blob/main/copra-v3-audit-1/src/utils/LiquidityWarehouseAccessControl.sol#L105-L116) which is on charge to allow the execution of whitelisted actions.
- **The problem is that the external call is capable of sending the native token, but the [`LiquidityWarehouse.execute() function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-copra-finance-stalinMacias/blob/main/copra-v3-audit-1/src/LiquidityWarehouse.sol#L248-L254) is not a payable function.** Also, the receive() or fallback() functions are not implemented on the contract, so, the only means the contract could have to receive the native token to send it to the target contract would be by receiving the native within the same call to the [`LiquidityWarehouse.execute() function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-copra-finance-stalinMacias/blob/main/copra-v3-audit-1/src/LiquidityWarehouse.sol#L248-L254), or in other words, if the exernal call to the target required to send native, the only way that native could be send to the target would be by sending it as part of the call to the [`LiquidityWarehouse.execute() function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-copra-finance-stalinMacias/blob/main/copra-v3-audit-1/src/LiquidityWarehouse.sol#L248-L254).
- **But, because the [`LiquidityWarehouse.execute() function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-copra-finance-stalinMacias/blob/main/copra-v3-audit-1/src/LiquidityWarehouse.sol#L248-L254) is not a payable function,** if the `executeActions.value` != 0, the whole execution will revert because the LiquidityWarehouse won't have any native to send to the target contract.

```solidity
function execute(LiquidityWarehouseAccessControl.ExecuteAction[] calldata executeActions)
    external
    override
    nonReentrant
{
    //@audit-issue => The execute() is not a payable function, thus, it does not allow the senders to send native when calling it!
    _execute(executeActions, msg.sender == owner());
}


function _execute(ExecuteAction[] calldata executeActions, bool isOwner) internal {
    for (uint256 i; i < executeActions.length; ++i) {
        ...
        
        //@audit-issue => If `executeActions.value` != 0, execution will revert because the contract has no native tokens to send to the target!
        (bool success,) = executeAction.target.call{value: executeAction.value}(executeAction.data);
        if (!success) revert ExecutionFailed(executeAction.target, msg.sender, fnSelector);
    }
}


```


## Impact
Impossible to execute whitelisted actions that require to send the native token.

## Recommendation
Make payable the [`LiquidityWarehouse.execute() function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-copra-finance-stalinMacias/blob/main/copra-v3-audit-1/src/LiquidityWarehouse.sol#L248-L254).

```solidity
function execute(LiquidityWarehouseAccessControl.ExecuteAction[] calldata executeActions)
    external
+   payable
    override
    nonReentrant
{
    _execute(executeActions, msg.sender == owner());
}
