Duplicate of #300 ==> VaultFactory allows deployment of vaults with non-authentic TwabController and PrizePool

## Title
Liquidator can liquidate the max amout of _liquidableYield for as low as 1 wei of PrizeTokens

## Impact
- The reward mechanism won't work as expected because the PrizePool won't be filled with the expected amount of PrizeTokens that the liquidator should contribute to the PrizePool when liquidating the yield fees

- Liquidator can get away with all the yield fees without contributing the equivalent amount of PrizeTokens to the PrizePool contract

## Proof of Concept
- This issue is caused because [the vault's owner can set the liquidator address to be any arbitrary address](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L665-L683), instead of deploying a new Liquidator contract and assign it as the liquidator of the vault.
  - If the liquidator can be any address, it can call the [`Vault::liquidate()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L550-L587) and pass 1 wei as the `_amountIn` parameter, in the function's execution it will [contribute to the PrizePool the exact received amount of `_amounIn` PrizeTokens.](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L570)
    - The expected behavior is that the Liquidator contract will compute in advance how many PrizeTokens must be contributed to the PrizePool in exchange of liquidating the `_amountOut` up to the maximum available yield fees, but if the liquidator is set to be an address of a contract other than the real Liquidator contract, then the vault's owner can use this fake Liquidator contract to liquidate the max available yield fee for as low as 1 wei of PrizeToken.

    - This will cause that the PrizePool will never receive any PrizeTokens for further distribution among the Vault depositors.
    - Liquidator will take away all the yield fee that was generated using the Vault depositor's assets and they won't receive any reward from having deposited their assets
    
    - Basically the core purpose of the PoolTogether Vaults will be broken and PrizePool won't receive 
    any PrizeTokens to distribute to the Vault Depositors

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- The recommendation is to not allow vault owners to set the Liquidator to be an arbitrary address, if the protocol is creating a contract for the Liquidators, then, force the Vaults to use such a contract.
  - On the [`Vault:setLiquidatonPair()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L665-L683), remove the `liquidationPair_` parameter and instead deploy a new contract and assing the address of the newly deployed Liquidator as the `_liquidationPair` of for the Vault.
```solidity
  function setLiquidationPair(
-   LiquidationPair liquidationPair_
  ) external onlyOwner returns (address) {
-    if (address(liquidationPair_) == address(0)) revert LPZeroAddress();

    IERC20 _asset = IERC20(asset());
    address _previousLiquidationPair = address(_liquidationPair);

    if (_previousLiquidationPair != address(0)) {
      _asset.safeApprove(_previousLiquidationPair, 0);
    }

+    _liquidationPair = new LiquidationPair(<LiquidationConstructorParameters>);

    _asset.safeApprove(address(liquidationPair_), type(uint256).max);

-   _liquidationPair = liquidationPair_;

    emit LiquidationPairSet(liquidationPair_);
    return address(liquidationPair_);
  }
```
