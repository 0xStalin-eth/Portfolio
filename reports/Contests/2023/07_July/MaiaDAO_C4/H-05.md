# High Severity

## Title
Denormalizing Decimals returns the amount scaled up by an incorrect magnitude for tokens that uses decimals different than 18

## Impact
- Incorrectly computing the magnitude of the token amounts when denormalizing the decimals will make that that the contracts transfer to the users more tokens than what it should be transfered.
- Using an incorrect magnitude can impact the internal accounting and balances in the system, which could lead to losses or even DoS in functions dependant on the internal accounting & balances.

## Proof of Concept
- The [current formula to normalize the decimals](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/main/src/ulysses-omnichain/BranchPort.sol#L383-L390) is the below one:
```solidity
function _denormalizeDecimals(uint256 _amount, uint8 _decimals) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return _decimals == 18 ? _amount : _amount * 1 ether / (10 ** _decimals);
}
```

- By doing the math we have:
```
```
  - Example 1: A token that has 8 decimals:
      - **`_amount` is scaled up by `10**18` because is the amount that is deposited inside the system, and all the deposits were normalized to 18 decimals**

      - The formula:         `_amount * 1 ether / (10 ** _decimals)`
      - Substituting values: `[(10**18) * (10**18)] / (10**8)` ===> `(10**36) / (10**8)` ===> `10**28`
      - result:              `10**28`
```
```
  - Example 2: A token that has 30 decimals:
      - **`_amount` is scaled up by `10**18` because is the amount that is deposited inside the system, and all the deposits were normalized to 18 decimals**

      - The formula:         `_amount * 1 ether / (10 ** _decimals)`
      - Substituting values: `[(10**18) * (10**18)] / (10**30)` ===> `(10**36) / (10**30)` ===> `10**6`
      - result:              `10**6`
```
```
- As demonstrated in the above examples, the current formula always returns the amount scaled up by a different magnitude than the tokenDecimals, which **is incorrect because [this formula should denormalize the amounts from 18 decimals to the tokenDecimals](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/main/src/ulysses-omnichain/BranchPort.sol#L384)**

Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Make sure to update the formula as follows to correctly denormalize the decimals from 18 to the tokenDecimals :
```solidity
function _denormalizeDecimals(uint256 _amount, uint8 _decimals) internal pure returns (uint256) {
-   return _decimals == 18 ? _amount : _amount * 1 ether / (10 ** _decimals);
+   return _decimals == 18 ? _amount : _amount * (10 ** _decimals) / 1 ether;
}
```

- By doing the math using the suggested change we have:
```
```
  - Example 1: A token that has 8 decimals:
      - **`_amount` is scaled up by `10**18` because is the amount that is deposited inside the system, and all the deposits were normalized to 18 decimals**

      - The formula:         `_amount * (10 ** _decimals) / 1 ether`
      - Substituting values: `[(10**18) * (10**8)] / (10**18)` ===> `(10**26) / (10**18)` ===> `10**8`
      - result:              `10**8`
```
```
  - Example 2: A token that has 30 decimals:
      - **`_amount` is scaled up by `10**18` because is the amount that is deposited inside the system, and all the deposits were normalized to 18 decimals**

      - The formula:         `_amount * (10 ** _decimals) / 1 ether`
      - Substituting values: `[(10**18) * (10**30)] / (10**18)` ===> `(10**48) / (10**18)` ===> `10**30`
      - result:              `10**30`
