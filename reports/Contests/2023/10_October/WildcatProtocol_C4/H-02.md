# High Severity

## Title
Markets can't be closed because the Controller contract has not defined in any function a refernce to call the closeMarket() function

## Impact
- Borrowers will never be able to close markets.

## Proof of Concept
- The [`WildcatMarket::closeMarket() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/market/WildcatMarket.sol#L142-L161) has defined the [`onlyController` modifier](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/market/WildcatMarketBase.sol#L136-L139), which validates that the caller is the Controller that was registered when the Market was deployed, this means that only the Controller contract is allowed to call this function, but, in the [`WildcatMarketController` contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatMarketController.sol) there is not any single reference that calls the closeMarket() function.
    - As we can see in the below code, the onlyController modifier is validating the caller to be the Controller, otherwise, the call to the closeMarket() is reverted.

> WildcatMarketBase contract
```solidity
  modifier onlyController() {
    //@audit-info => If caller is not the controller contract, the tx is reverted!
    if (msg.sender != controller) revert NotController();
    _;
  }
```

> WildcatMarket contract
```solidity
  //@audit-info => onlyController modifier enforces that the only allowed caller is the Controller contract
  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {
    ...
    ...
    ...
  }
```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- There are two possible solutions to resolve this problem
    - The first option is to make sure to create a new function in the Controller contract and implement the required logic to validate that only valid borrowers can call valid markets they own, and if so, do the actual call to the closeMaker()
    - The second option could be to change the modifier in the closeMarket() function, instead of using the onlyController modifier, opt to use the onlyBorrower() modifier, which it validates the caller is the borrower, otherwise the tx is reverted
