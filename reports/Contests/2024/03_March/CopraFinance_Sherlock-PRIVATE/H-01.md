# Title
Withdrawers can call any function on a TeaVault contract on behalf of the TeahouseLiquidityWarehouse contract

## Summary
Withdrawers can construct a malicious calldata that will be forwarded to the `TeaVault` and can allow the user to call any function on the `TeaVault` on behalf of the `TeahouseLiquidityWarehouse` contract

## Vulnerability Detail
The process to withdraw liquidity from a TeahouseVault consists of 2 steps, the first one is to withdraw asset1 & asset2 from the vault by specifying a certain amount of shares to be withdrawn, and the second step is to do a swap of the withdrawn assets, one of the two assets is != than the asset that is used inside the TeahouseLiquidityWarehouse contract, that is why is required to swap that asset for the asset that is used in the TeahouseLiquidityWarehouse.
- **The problem is that the data to do the swap is directly taken from the arguments that were passed to the [`LiquidityWarehouse:withdrawLender() function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-copra-finance-stalinMacias/blob/main/copra-v3-audit-1/src/LiquidityWarehouse.sol#L179-L201), this data is not sanitized** to validate that a swap function on the TeaVault will actually be called, this basically **allows the caller to construct any data that will be forwarded to the TeaVault to execute functions on behalf of the TeahouseLiquidityWarehouse contract.**
  - A withdrawer could construct a very elaborated data to withdraw all the TeahouseLiquidityWarehouse's liquidity from the TeaVault, thus, interrupting the yield accrual proccess.

```solidity
function _withdrawFromTarget(uint256 withdrawAmount, address withdrawTarget, bytes memory swapData)
    internal
    override
{
    // Other option is to pass in the teahouse vault addresses in swapData
    for (uint256 i; i < s_teahouseVaults.length(); ++i) {
        address teahouseVaultAddr = s_teahouseVaults.at(i);
        bytes[] memory data = new bytes[](2);

        ...
        //@audit-issue => Not sanitizing/validating that the swapData parameter will actually call a swap() on the TeaVault contract!
        // 2) Action to swap
        data[1] = swapData; // TODO:  Can be improved later but this is for illustration purposes

        //@audit-issue => Forwarding the constructed data to the TeaVault.multicall() to execute on behalf of the TeahouseLiquidityWarehouse contract!
        ITeaVaultV3PairHelper(withdrawTarget).multicall(ITeaVaultV3Pair(teahouseVaultAddr), 0, 0, data);
    }
}

```

## Impact
Withdrawers can construct a malicious calldata that will be forwarded to the `TeaVault` and can allow the user to call any function on the `TeaVault` on behalf of the `TeahouseLiquidityWarehouse` contract

## Tool used
Manual Review & [TeaVault contract](https://github.com/TeahouseFinance/TeaVaultV3Pair/blob/main/contracts/TeaVaultV3Pair.sol)

## Recommendation
Either sanitize the received `data` and validate that it will call a swap function, or even better and opt to encode the data by using the `abiEncodeWithSelector` and the swap function that should be called alongside the required parameters to do the swap.
