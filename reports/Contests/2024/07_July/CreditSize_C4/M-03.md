## Title
CreditSellers are not charged the swapFee for receiving cash when their SellCredit LimitOrders are filled by a liquidation with replacement

## Impact
The CreditSellers who are appointed as the replacement borrower receives the full (issuanceValue) without paying the swapFee for receiving cash.

## Proof of Concept
When liquidating with replacement, a new borrower (CreditSeller) receives an amount of cash that is computed based on the futureValue of the existing loan, and the `ratePerTenor` that reflects the remaining duration of the loan and the specified APR by the new borrower, this amount of cash is sent directly to the new borrower, and the loan been liquidated is re-assigned to him.

Basically, **the new borrower is SellingCredit for Cash.** The borrower's limit order was filled, instead of been filled with a MarketOrder, it was filled with a liquidation with replacement, but, in the end, the CreditSeller (borrower) received cash in exchange for credit.
- **The problem is that [the `swapFee` is not charged on the amount of cash the new borrower receives.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/LiquidateWithReplacement.sol#L161)**

All borrowers who gets filled their SellCredit LimitOrders by a liqudiation with replacement won't pay the swapFee, as opposed to borrowers who get their orders filled by a MarketOrder.

```
function executeLiquidateWithReplacement(State storage state, LiquidateWithReplacementParams calldata params)
    external
    returns (uint256 issuanceValue, uint256 liquidatorProfitCollateralToken, uint256 liquidatorProfitBorrowToken)
{
    ...
    issuanceValue = Math.mulDivDown(debtPositionCopy.futureValue, PERCENT, PERCENT + ratePerTenor);
    liquidatorProfitBorrowToken = debtPositionCopy.futureValue - issuanceValue;

    debtPosition.borrower = params.borrower;
    debtPosition.futureValue = debtPositionCopy.futureValue;
    debtPosition.liquidityIndexAtRepayment = 0;

    ...

    state.data.debtToken.mint(params.borrower, debtPosition.futureValue);
    //@audit-issue => The new borrower receives the `issuanceValue` without paying swapFees
    state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(address(this), params.borrower, issuanceValue);
    state.data.borrowAToken.transferFrom(address(this), state.feeConfig.feeRecipient, liquidatorProfitBorrowToken);
}
```

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Compute the `swapFee` to be charged for the `issuanceValue` and charge it to the replacement borrower. Deduct it from the `issuanceValue` and send it to the `feeRecipient`
