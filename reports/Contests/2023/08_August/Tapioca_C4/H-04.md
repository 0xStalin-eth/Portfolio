# High Severity

## Title
- Attacker can use Magnetar contract to extract assets from user's accounts and deposit them into the YieldBox, and by using a fake market contract it can transfer the deposited assets in the YieldBox to an address of his own

## Impact
- User's assets can be extracted from their accounts before they are deposited into the YieldBox by using the Magnetar contract, and by using a fake market contract, an attacker can transfer those assets to an address of his own. 

## Proof of Concept
- Users can use the [`Magnetar::depositRepayAndRemoveCollateralFromMarket()`](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/023751a4e987cf7c203ab25d3abba58f7344f213/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L802-L838) function to deposit asset to YieldBox, repay on a market, remove collateral and withdraw, but before the function can be executed, the users need to grant allowance to the Magnetar contract to spend the asset tokens on their behalf.
- The depositRepayAndRemoveCollateralFromMarket() function basically extracts the asset tokens from the users account, deposit them into the YieldBox and then it can repay the user's debt using those deposited assets, also it can remove collateral from the market and withdraw it to his account on any supported chain by the protocol.

- **The problem is** that the depositRepayAndRemoveCollateralFromMarket() function can be exploited by an attacker because it lacks validation to check if the assets are going to be extracted from the `user` address (which is a parameter) or from the caller (msg.sender), and also lacks validation to verify if the provided `market` address is a legit, suported market by the protocol.
  - These two flaws in combination allows attackers to steal user's assets from their accounts by using the Magnetar contract.

### Practical Example:
- A user has taken a borrow in a singularity market and now is planning to repay it, for convenience it will use the Magnetar contract to perform the whole process required to repay the debt and get back his assets.
  - The user will use the `depositRepayAndRemoveCollateralFromMarket()` function, user grants allowance to the Magnetar contract on the asset's contract for the total amount that will be deposited.
  - An attacker detects that the Magnetar contract has received allowance on the asset's contract and goes ahead to perform the attack to steal the user's assets.
    - The attacker basically needs to call the depositRepayAndRemoveCollateralFromMarket(), and pass as parameters an address of a fake market as the `market` address, the user's address as the `user` address, the amount of assets that will be stolen (the exact amount that the Magnetar contract has allowance), and set to `false` the `extractFromSender` variable (this will make the Magnetar contract to extract the assets from the `user` account)
      - Example of the parameters that the attacker needs to send:
```
await magnetar
    .connect(attacker)
    .depositRepayAndRemoveCollateralFromMarket(
        fakeMarket.address,
        eoa1.address,
        userBorrowPart.mul(2), //depositAmount
        userBorrowPart, //repayAmount
        0, //collateralAmount
        false,
        {
            // withdraw: true,
            withdraw: false,
            withdrawLzFeeAmount: 0,
            withdrawOnOtherChain: false,
            withdrawLzChainId: 0,
            withdrawAdapterParams: ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes(''),
        },
    );
```
    - As a result, the user's assets will be stolen from his account and transfered to an account controlled by the attacker.

### Coded PoC
- I coded a PoC to demonstrate this vulnerability, I used the [`magnetar.test.ts`](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/023751a4e987cf7c203ab25d3abba58f7344f213/test/magnetar.test.ts) file as the base for this PoC.

1. The first step is to add the `attacker` account in the [`test.utils.ts`](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/023751a4e987cf7c203ab25d3abba58f7344f213/test/test.utils.ts) file

2. Let's create the `FakeMarket` contract, create it under the [`tapioca-periph-audit/contract/`](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/tree/023751a4e987cf7c203ab25d3abba58f7344f213/contracts) folder

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- If tokens will be extracted from the `user`, check if the caller is the user, if not, extract the tokens from the caller's account
- Verify that the `market` is a legit market, you can use the Penrose contract to validate if the specified market address is a supported market by the protocol.

- Add the below changes to the [`_depositRepayAndRemoveCollateralFromMarket()`](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/023751a4e987cf7c203ab25d3abba58f7344f213/contracts/Magnetar/modules/MagnetarMarketModule.sol#L212-L290)
