# High Severity

## Title
Message channels between two chains can be blocked due to missing check of minimum gas passed resulting in DoS

## Impact
The communication channel between a branch chain and a destination chain can be blocked by exploiting the ability to specify arbitrary gas parameters for the destination chain function calls.
Consistently (and at a low cost) block communication between the source chaind and a destination chain (which can only be unblocked through a manual intervention) 
This is issue affects the DcntEth contract which inherits from OFTv2, which in its inheritanche chain inherits from the NonBlockingLzApp, but, the DcntEth doesn't override the lzSend function and doesnt perform an input validation, which gives attackers the ability to specify whatever adapterParams they want to send to lz.

## Proof of Concept
Root causes:
1. User can specify any gas params against best-practice guidelines
2. DcntEth inherist from OFTv2, which inherits from the NonBlockingLzApp, but the DcntEth contract doesn't handle the "in-blocking scenario"

While sending messages through LayerZero, the sender can specify how much gas he is willing to give to the Relayer to deliver the payload to the destination chain. This configuration is specified in relayer adapter params.
- if no minimum gas is enforced, because the DcntEth contract uses the NonBlockingApp can end up in a situation where there is a StoredPayload and the pathway is blocked.

The _gasLimit used here for the lzReceive call is the _gasLimit that was provided by Bob. But because Bob has specified a gasLimit of 1 he forces the call from the Endpoint contract to RootBridgeAgent::lzReceive() to revert due to an out-of-gas error. This causes the Endpoint contract to store the payload. This blocks any subsequent cross-chain messages for that chain which will revert with LayerZero: in message blocking.

## Attack Explanation
The normal flow for a bridge operation (which will send a crosschain message through LayerZero) it is expected to start at the [`UTB:bridgeAndExecute() function`](), and all the provided data is expected to be crafted and signed by an api offered by the protocol, such an api we assume that would compute the correct values for the gas to be paid for the layer zero execution. One way to do it is by calling the [`DecentEthRouter::estimateSendAndCallFee() function`]() to determine the amount of gas that should be required to run an operation.
**The problem we identified is**, users can directly call the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload() function`]() and provide any value for the parameters that this function receives, one of those parameters is the `_dstGasForCall`, which in a normal operation, this value was computed by the [`DecentEthRouter::estimateSendAndCallFee() function`](). But, since a malicious user can directly call the [`DecentEthRouter::estimateSendAndCallFee() function`](), that means that the **user can provide a really low value for the `_dstGasForCall` variable**. ***This will cause the execution on layer zero to revert because a gas exception***, **which will cause that the communication channels to be halted until the operations are manually resumed.**
- The objective is that due to this small gas passed the transaction reverts somewhere inside the [lzReceive function](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/solidity-examples/blob/ca7d4f1d482df5e17f8aaf1b34d0e4432020bc4e/contracts/lzApp/LzApp.sol#L35-L52) and the message pathway is blocked, resulting in [StoredPayload](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero/blob/main/contracts/Endpoint.sol#L122).
- The objective of the attack is that the execution doesn't reach the [NonblockingLzApp](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/solidity-examples/blob/ca7d4f1d482df5e17f8aaf1b34d0e4432020bc4e/contracts/lzApp/NonblockingLzApp.sol#L24-L39) since then the behavior of the NonBlockingLzApp would be as expected and the pathway wouldn't be blocked,
but rather the message would be stored inside the [failedMessages](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/solidity-examples/blob/ca7d4f1d482df5e17f8aaf1b34d0e4432020bc4e/contracts/lzApp/NonblockingLzApp.sol#L18)


## Tools Used
Manual Audit & LayerZero

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
The minimum gas enforced to send for each and every _lzSend in the app should be enough to cover the worst-case scenario for the transaction to reach the [first try/catch](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/solidity-examples/blob/ca7d4f1d482df5e17f8aaf1b34d0e4432020bc4e/contracts/lzApp/NonblockingLzApp.sol#L35-L38)

Since this issue is present because any user could specify a very low amount for the gas that is sent to layer zero by calling the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload() function`](). The most straight-forward mitigation would be to ensure that only authorized parties can directly call this function, such trusted entities must have been already verified that the amount of gas that will be sent to layer zero is at least enough to cover for the execution, without causing the tx to revert because a gas exception.
