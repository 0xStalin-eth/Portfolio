# High Severity

## Title
hardcoding the gas refundee of the lz calls will cause the users to lost the excess gas that should've been refunded to them

## Impact
Users will lose any excess gas they pay for LZ calls because the `refundee` address is incorrectly hardcoded to be the `msg.sender` of the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload() function`]() rather than the `refund` address the user specified

## Proof of Concept
When a crosschain message is sent through LayerZero it is required to prepare a calldata that it'll be sent to the LayerZero contracts. One of the parameter for this calldata it is the `refundAddress`, which indicates to the LayerZero contracts where to refund the excess gas that was paid for the transaction in case that the transaction's cost is cheaper than the amount of value passed.

This is the execution flow when a user wants to perform a bridge of funds from one chain to another
1. The user starts the execution by calling the a [`UTB::bridgeAndExecute()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L259-L274) function, here the fees for the operation are charged, a swap pre-bridge its executed && the swapParams for the swap post-bridge are prepared, then execution goes to the [`UTB::callBridge()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L282-L301) function
2. In the [`UTB::callBridge()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L282-L301) function, some approvals are granted to the `DecentBridgeAdapter` contract, and then the execution is forwarded to the [`DecentBridgeAdapter::bridge()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/bridge_adapters/DecentBridgeAdapter.sol#L81-L125) function
3. In the [`DecentBridgeAdapter::bridge()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/bridge_adapters/DecentBridgeAdapter.sol#L81-L125) function, some data is encoded and decoded to prepare the calldata for the bridge, and then the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload() function`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L197-L215) is called.
4. When the execution reaches the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L197-L215) function, **the `msg.sender` is be the `DecentBridgeAdapter` contract's address**, (from step 3 to step 4, the caller is the `DecentBridgeAdapter` contract), when the LZCallParams are defined in the [`DecentEthRouter::_bridgeWithPayload()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L148-L194) function, the [`callParams.refundAddress` is set to `msg.sender`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L171).
- By setting the `callParams.refundAddress` to be the `msg.sender`, what is happening is that **the `DecentBridgeAdapater` contract is set as the refundAddress for the excess gas that was paid for the execution**, instead of setting the `refundAddress` to be an address controller by the user.
  - This will cause that the `DecentBridgeAdapter` contract receives the refund of excess gas instead of an account controlled by the user who initiated the bridge operation. 
    - The `DecentBridgeAdapter` contract will accumulate a balance, and **the user losses the excess gas that was paid for the lz call**, which means that **instead of refunding the excess gas to an account controlled by the user**, ***any excess gas in the destination chain will be refunded to the address of the `DecentBridgeAdapater contract`***.

5. From the [`DecentEthRouter::_bridgeWithPayload()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L148-L194) function, the execution is sent to the `DcntEth::sendAndCall() function` where it will end up calling the [`LayerZeroEndpoint::send()`](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero/blob/main/contracts/Endpoint.sol#L92-L96) function. 

6. Once the execution reaches the LayerZeroEndpoint contract, at the end of the execution of the [`LayerZeroEndpoint::send() function`](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero/blob/main/contracts/Endpoint.sol#L92-L96), the endpoint contract computes if there is any leftover gas that was paid but was not spent, if so, [it refunds the excess gas to the `_refundAddress`](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero/blob/main/contracts/UltraLightNodeV2.sol#L152-L156) that was passed in the `callParams.refundAddress`. **The problem is that the `callParams.refundAddress` was encoded as the `msg.sender` who called the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload()`]() function [Step 4].** This will cause that **the refunded excess gas is sent to the DecentBridgeAdapater contract instead of an account controlled by the user.**

## Tools Used
Manual Audit, [LayerZero Documentation](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/evm-guides/evm-solidity-interfaces/ilayerzeroendpoint) & [LayerZeroEndpoint contract](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero/blob/main/contracts/UltraLightNodeV2.sol#L152-L156)

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Instead of hardcoding the `refundAddress` to be the `msg.sender`, use the `refundee` address that was already provided by the user. This address was passed in the calldata sent to the [`UTB::bridgeAndExecute() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L259-L274), specifically, the refundAddress specified by the user is encoded in the `instructions.refund` variable.
- Make sure to decode the encoded calldata that gets to the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload()`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L197-L215) function. Read the value of the `instructions.refund` variable that was sent at the beginning of the execution, and use that address to set the `callParams.refundAddress` which specifies the address where the excess gas paid to LayerZero should be refunded.
