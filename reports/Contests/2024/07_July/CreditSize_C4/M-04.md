## Title
Borrowers can DoS Lenders from Selling Credit from their Existing CreditPositions by compensating the CreditPosition been sold

## Impact
Borrowers can DoS Lenders from selling credit (partial or full credit positions) by frontrunning and compensating the exact CreditPositionId that is been sold 

## Proof of Concept
CreditSellers can sale credit from their existing CreditPositions, by doing it they will practically be giving Credit in exchange for Cash. They can sell a partial amount of Credit, or a full CreditPosition.
- If CreditSeller is partially selling a CreditPosition, the CreditBuyer will get assigned a new CreditPosition for the amount of credit bought.
- If CreditSeller is fully selling a CreditPosition, the CreditBuyer will get re-assigned the same CreditPosition that was owned by the CreditSeller.

In either of the two cases, [the maximum amount of credit that can be sold is the amount of credit the CreditPosition has available.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/SellCreditMarket.sol#L87-L89)
- Here is where the borrowers can play and DoS lenders from selling credit whenever they need/want to.

When a Borrower compensates a DebtPosition using the [`Size.compensate() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/Size.sol#L247-L251), the Borrower specifies a CreditPositionId that will be compensated, and, depending on the amount of credit that CreditPosition has, it defines the maximum amount of debt that the borrower can compensate on that execution. A Borrower can decide to compensate anywhere from the minimum allowed amount up to all the credit of the CreditPosition. Once the Compensation is completed, the amount of Credit on that CreditPosition is equally deducted from the amount of debt compensated.
- This means, when a borrower fully compensates a CreditPosition, this CreditPosition will end up with 0 credit, as such, any operation that depends on the credit of such CreditPosition will revert, for example, claiming or selling credit from a CreditPosition, because, again, it has 0 credits after the compensation was completed.

```
function executeCompensate(State storage state, CompensateParams calldata params) external {
    emit Events.Compensate(
        params.creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId, params.creditPositionToCompensateId, params.amount
    );

    ...

    CreditPosition memory creditPositionToCompensate;
    if (params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID) {
      //@audit => When the compensator passes RESERVE_ID, a new Credit and Debt Positions will be created.
      //@audit => The same borrower of the CreditPosition being compensated remains as the borrower on the new CreditPosition!
        creditPositionToCompensate = state.createDebtAndCreditPositions({
            lender: msg.sender,
            borrower: msg.sender,
            futureValue: amountToCompensate,
            dueDate: debtPositionToRepay.dueDate
        });
    } else {
        ...
    }

    //@audit => The credit of the CreditPosition being compensated is reduced by the amount of debt being compensated.
    // debt and credit reduction
    state.reduceDebtAndCredit(
        creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.debtPositionId, params.creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId, amountToCompensate
    );

    uint256 exiterCreditRemaining = creditPositionToCompensate.credit - amountToCompensate;

    //@audit => Creates a new CreditPosition for the Lender of the CreditPosition being compensated
    // credit emission
    state.createCreditPosition({
        exitCreditPositionId: params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID
            ? state.data.nextCreditPositionId - 1
            : params.creditPositionToCompensateId,
        lender: creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.lender,
        credit: amountToCompensate
    });
    ...
}
```

This opens the doors for borrowers to DoS Lenders who want to sell credit from their existing credit positions. For example:
- LenderA wants to sell 100 credit from his CreditPosition, but, BorrowerA frontruns the tx to sell the credit, and, the borrower compensates the CreditPosition that LenderA wants to sell. 
  - As a result, after the compensation is completed, the CreditPosition of LenderA will now have 0 Credit and won't be able to sell credit from that position, it would need to sell credit from the new position that was assigned to him after the compensation, and, again, the borrower can do the same with the new CreditPosition. 
    - The CreditSeller won't be able to sell the credit he wants, and, get the cash he needs.

Since the Credit Lenders are the owners of the CreditPositions, they should be able to to with the credit they own what they wish, without getting negatively impacted by the borrower. As such, a medium severity seems a reasonable severity for this DoS vector since the borrowers (who don't own the credit, but rather, the owe it), can DoS the Credit Owners from selling it.

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Similar as to how CreditPositions can be disabled for sale, apply the same logic to compensation, allow the CreditOwners/Lenders to disable their CreditPositions from been compensated if they want it.
