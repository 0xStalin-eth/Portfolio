## Title
`Vault.harvestRewards()` is uncallable because the owner of the Vault (VaultManager) has not defined a function that would allow it to call it

## Finding description and impact
### Impact
[`Vault.harvestRewards()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/vault/ConcreteMultiStrategyVault.sol#L989-L1025)is uncallable by the VaultManager

### Finding Description
The VaultManager is set as the Owner of the Vaults, this is clearly deducted by the fact that all the functions on the Vaults restricted to be called only by the owner, are the same functions that can be called from the VaultManager contract by accounts with the `VAULT_MANAGER_ROLE`.
- For example, the [`Vault.setVaultFees()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/vault/ConcreteMultiStrategyVault.sol#L744-L747) which can only be called by the owner, is a function that is callable by an account with the `VAULT_MANAGER_ROLE` from the [`VaultManager.setVaultFees()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/managers/VaultManager.sol#L99-L101).

**The problem is that, the [`VaultManager contract`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/managers/VaultManager.sol) is missing a function that would allow it to call the [`Vault.harvestRewards()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/vault/ConcreteMultiStrategyVault.sol#L989-L1025).**

## Proof of Concept
No Coded PoC, all details are explained on the Finding Description section.

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add a new function on the VaultManager to allow the `VAULT_MANAGER_ROLE` to call the [`Vault.harvestRewards()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/vault/ConcreteMultiStrategyVault.sol#L989-L1025) with any required data to harvest the rewards earned on the Vault's strategies.
