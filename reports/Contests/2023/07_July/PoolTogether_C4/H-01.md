# High Severity

# Result
duplicate of #396 ===> Vault.mintYieldFee FUNCTION CAN BE CALLED BY ANYONE TO MINT Vault Shares TO ANY RECIPIENT ADDRESS

## Title
Anybody can steal all the yield fees generated on vaults 

## Impact
- Anybody can steal all the yield fees on all the vaults and get some free shares on all the vaults, which those shares can later be used to redeem underlying assets held by the vault, which will make malicious users steal a portion of the principal deposited by the users in the vaults.

## Proof of Concept

- Before diving into the explanation of the issue, is important to point to the references in the contract that states who should receive the yield fees
  - There is a contract variable called `_yieldFeeRecipient`, as per the [inline comment in the code it says that](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L226-L227): **The `_yieldFeeRecipient` is the address of the yield fee recipient that receives the fee amount when yield is captured.**
  - The second important reference is [when the `_yieldFeeTotalSupply` variable is updated](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L848-L854), this same variable is used in the `Vault::mintYieldFee()` to determine how many shares the `receiver` can get

  - All the comments regarding the yield fees in the code state that **the real yield fees receiver must be the address stored in the `_yieldFeeRecipient` variable.**

  - Now, with this context in mind, let's dive into the explanation of the root cause of this issue.

- Anybody can call the [Vault::mintYieldFee()](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L394-L402) function because it is an external function and it has no access control mechanism.
  - The root issue is caused because the address that will receive the yield fee is received as a parameter.
  - That means that **anybody can call Vault::mintYieldFee() and set an address of their own as the receiver address.**

- Through all the process to mint the yield fee there is no check to validate that the caller of the mintYieldFee() is the real receiver, the process assumes the the `_recipient` address is the correct receiver.

- The process to mint the yield fee is as follows:
1. After a couple of checks to validate that the requested amount of shares to be minted can actually be minted, it calls the [`Vault::_mint()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L1122-L1127)
2. `Vault::_mint()` calls the [`_twabController.mint()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-twab-controller/blob/0145eeac23301ee5338c659422dd6d69234f5d50/src/TwabController.sol#L457-L459) and forwards the value of the `_recipient` parameter that was received on the `Vault::mintYieldFee()`
3. Now, the `_twabController.mint()` function calls the internal [`_twabController.transferBalance()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-twab-controller/blob/0145eeac23301ee5338c659422dd6d69234f5d50/src/TwabController.sol#L515-L582), finally in this function after performing a couple of checks it will increase the balance of the `_recipient` address as well as increase the total supply balance of the Vault that is minting new shares to the `recipient`
4. The end result will be that a malicious user minted to himself all the yield fee, the `_yieldFeeTotalSupply` has been deducted by the number of shares minted, and now the malicious user has gained for free some shares of the Vault contract that can be used to redeem the underlying asset that was deposit by real users into the Vault contract.

- Now the malicious user can simply call the `Vault::redeem()` function to redeem the shares that have just stolen.
  - The malicious user will receive a portion of the underlying asset that was deposited by real users into the Vault contract

Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Don't receive the `recipient` of the yield fee as a parameter, instead, make sure to use the contract variable `_yieldFeeRecipient` as the receiver of the yield fee.
```solidity
-   function mintYieldFee(uint256 _shares, address _recipient) external {
+   function mintYieldFee(uint256 _shares) external {
        _requireVaultCollateralized();
        if (_shares > _yieldFeeTotalSupply) revert YieldFeeGTAvailable(_shares, _yieldFeeTotalSupply);

        _yieldFeeTotalSupply -= _shares;
-       _mint(_recipient, _shares);
+       _mint(_yieldFeeRecipient, _shares);

        emit MintYieldFee(msg.sender, _recipient, _shares);
    }
```
