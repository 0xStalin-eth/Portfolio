# Medium Severity
## Title
Using Uniswap Spot Price to calculate the price when running the RootBridgeAgent::anyExecute() to swap the deposited gas

## Impact
Loss of funds caused by MEV bots sandwiching the transaction because the price can be easly manipulated.


## Proof of Concept
- On the [`RootBridgeAgent:anyExecute()` when swapping all the deposited gas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/main/src/ulysses-omnichain/RootBridgeAgent.sol#L884-L886) on the [`_gasSwapIn()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/main/src/ulysses-omnichain/RootBridgeAgent.sol#L659-L696) it is performed a swap, the problem is that [the swap uses the instantaneous price from slot0](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/main/src/ulysses-omnichain/RootBridgeAgent.sol#L674) instead of the TWAP price. The slot0 price is calculated from the ratios of the assets of the pool. This ratio can however be easily manipulated and cause the swap to receive less funds than what it could've received.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Use TWAP price instead of slot0 price. [Here](https://github.com/charmfinance/alpha-vaults-contracts/blob/07db2b213315eea8182427be4ea51219003b8c1a/contracts/AlphaStrategy.sol#L136-L144) is an example implementation of TWAP.
