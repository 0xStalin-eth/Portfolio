# High Severity

## Title
Address to refund the tokens being bridged is incorrectly assigned and will cause users to lose their funds in case the bridge execution fails in the destination chain.

## Impact
Users will lost all their bridged funds in case that the bridge execution fails in the destination chain.

## Proof of Concept
When a user is bridging tokens to perform an execution in the destination chain, the users initiates their transaction by:
1. Calling the [`UTB::bridgeAndExecute() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L259-L274), from there it will do the swap pre-bridge (in the src chain) & will modify the swapInstructions for the swap post-bridge (in the dest chain), then it will invoke the [`UTB::callBridge() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L282-L301)
2. In the [`UTB::callBridge() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L282-L301) some approvals are granted to the DecentBridgeAdapter contract, and then the execution is forwarded to the [`DecentBridgeAdapter::bridge() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/bridge_adapters/DecentBridgeAdapter.sol#L81-L125)
3. In the [`DecentBridgeAdapter::bridge() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/bridge_adapters/DecentBridgeAdapter.sol#L81-L125), some data is encoded and decoded to prepare the calldata for the bridge, and then the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload() function`]() is called.
4. When the execution reaches the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload() function`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L197-L215), **notice how the `msg.sender` in the DecentEthRouter contract will be the DecentBridgeAdapter contract**, (from step 3 to step 4, the caller is the DecentBridgeAdapter contract). When the `payload` that is sent for the execution in the destination chain is defined in the [`DecentEthRouter::_getCallParams() function`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L80-L111), which is called by the [`DecentEthRouter::_bridgeWithPayload() function`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L148-L194), the second parameter that is encoded as part of the `payload` variable it is set to be the `msg.sender`, keep in mind that the **`msg.sender` is the address of the DecentBridgeAdapter**, ***not the user's address or an address controlled by him.***
5. **From here onwards, the execution is sent to LayerZero, which will send the `payload` variable to the [`DecentEthRouter::onOFTReceived()` function]() in the destination chain**.

6. When the [`DecentEthRouter::onOFTReceived()` function](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L237-L282) is called, the received `_payload` is decoded and the encoded values are saved in individual variables,*** the one we are interested is the second variable***, **which is the `msg.sender` that was encoded in the [`DecentEthRouter::_getCallParams()` function](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L80-L111)**, then, if the crosschain message happens to be of an execute type, the execution will be forwarded to the [`DecentBridgeExecutor::execute() function`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentBridgeExecutor.sol#L68-L82)
7. In the [`DecentBridgeExecutor::execute() function`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentBridgeExecutor.sol#L68-L82), either the [`DecentBridgeExecutor::_executeWeth() function`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentBridgeExecutor.sol#L24-L45) or the [`DecentBridgeExecutor::_executeEth() function`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentBridgeExecutor.sol#L54-L65) are called, and the received `from` parameter (which was just decoded from the received payload in the `onOFTReceived()`) is forwarded to those functions.

![Steps 6 to 7 of the execution flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/djt3zbrr3/image/upload/v1706025863/Decent/refundBridgedFunds_steps_6_to_7.png)

8. In any of those functions, the execution will call the target contract (which is the `DecentBridgeAdapter::receiveFromBridge()` of the current chain).
9. If the call to the target contract reverts, all the bridged funds are refunded to the `from` parameter, which is exactly the `msg.sender` that was encoded in the [`DecentEthRouter::_getCallParams()` function](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L80-L111). (See step 4)
- Refunding to the `msg.sender` who called the [`DecentEthRouter::_getCallParams()` function](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L80-L111) in the source chain will cause that the **users lost all his bridged funds**, and ***instead, the DecentBridgeAdapter contract address of the source chain will be the one that received the refund of the bridged funds.***

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Instead of hardcoding the `refundAddress` to be the `msg.sender`, use the `refundee` address that was already provided by the user. This address was passed in the calldata sent to the [`UTB::bridgeAndExecute() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L259-L274), specifically, the refundAddress specified by the user is encoded in the `instructions.refund` variable.
- Make sure to decode the encoded calldata that gets to the [`DecentEthRouter::_getCallParams() function`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L80-L111). Read the value of the `instructions.refund` variable that was sent at the beginning of the execution, and use that address to set the second variable of the `payload` variable that is passed as a parameter for the execution in the destination chain.
