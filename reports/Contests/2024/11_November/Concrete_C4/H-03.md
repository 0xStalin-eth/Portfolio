## Title
Incorrectly computing the assets under management on the SiloStrategy.

## Finding description and impact
### Impact
totalAssets owned by a SiloStrategy are incorrectly computed leading to incorrect computation of sharesToAssets and assetsToShares.

### Finding Description
Each Strategy has its own function to compute the totalAssets under its management, for SiloStrategies, the current implementation simly queries the balanceOf the collateralToken owned by the strategy, and it threads this balance as if would represent underlying asset, when in reality, **this balance represents the Silo's shares owned by the Strategy for the deposited assets**, ***the problem is that when the ratio of shares-assets on Silo is not anymore 1:1,*** **`collateralToken.balanceOf(strategy)` will not be representing the real amount of underlyingAsset ownes by the strategy.**

shares-assets ratio will change when Silo receives interest payments, when this happens, the totalAssets increase and the shares remains the same, making each share more worth because it can withdraw more assets than before.
- But, if the SiloStrategy does not convert the shares to assets, any earned interest will be reflected on the assets under management of the SiloStrategy, and, as the shares become more worth on Silo, the Strategy's share will under calculate the assets owned by the strategy.

The `Strategy._totalAssets()` is an internal function that gets called each time the `Strategy.totalAssets()` is called. Some critical functions that makes use of the data returned by the `_totalAssets()` are the next two, which, as we can see, errors on those two functions because incorrectly calculating the totalAssets owned by the strategy will mess up the Strategy's accounting.

- [`ERC4626._convertToAssets()`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/723f8cab09cdae1aca9ec9cc1cfa040c2d4b06c1/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L259-L261)

## Proof of Concept
[`SiloV1Strategy._totalAssets()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/strategies/Silo/SiloV1Strategy.sol#L122-L126) queries collateralToken Silo's shares owned by the Strategy, but, these shares are not the underlyingAsset, and these shares can become more worth as interest is paid on the Silo protocol.
```solidity
function _totalAssets() internal view override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 shares = collateralToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    //@audit-issue => The Silo's shares owned by the strategy are threated as if they were the amount of underlying owned by the strategy (deposits in Silo).
    return shares;
    // return balanceOfUnderlying(shares);
}
```

By looking at the [`Silo ShareCollateralToken contract`](https://github.com/silo-finance/silo-core-v1/blob/master/contracts/utils/ShareCollateralToken.sol), we can see that the token is a normal ERC20 token, is not a special token like an aToken that makes special calculations on the `balanceOf()` to return the amount of underlyingAsset owned by the specified account, instead, the `balanceOf()` of the SiloCollateralToken simply returns the raw balance owned by the specified account, which means, the returned value from `collateralToken.balanceOf()` is just the amount of shares, and, to know the amount of underlyingAsset that those shares represents, is required to convert the shares to assets, which is the same process the withdrawal execution on Sillo follows, it computes the amount of requires shares to be burnt for the specified amount of assets to withdraw.

[`Silo._withdrawAsset()`](https://github.com/silo-finance/silo-core-v1/blob/master/contracts/BaseSilo.sol#L541-L600)
```solidity
function _withdrawAsset(
    address _asset,
    uint256 _assetAmount,
    ...
)
    internal
    returns (uint256 withdrawnAmount, uint256 burnedShare)
{
    ...

    //@audit => Amount of shares to burn for the amount to be withdrawn!
    if (_assetAmount == type(uint256).max) {
        burnedShare = shareToken.balanceOf(_depositor);
        withdrawnAmount = burnedShare.toAmount(assetTotalDeposits, shareToken.totalSupply());
    } else {
        burnedShare = _assetAmount.toShareRoundUp(assetTotalDeposits, shareToken.totalSupply());
        withdrawnAmount = _assetAmount;
    }

    ...

    shareToken.burn(_depositor, burnedShare);
    // in case token sent in fee-on-transfer type of token we do not care when withdrawing
    ERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_receiver, amountToTransfer);
}
```

[`ShareCollateralToken.sol`](https://github.com/silo-finance/silo-core-v1/blob/master/contracts/utils/ShareCollateralToken.sol)
- A simple ERC20 Token, no special logic on the `balanceOf()`.
 

## Tools Used
Manual Audit && Silo Contracts

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Convert the Silo's shares to underlyingAsset by using the [`SiloV1Strategy.balanceOfUnderlying()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/strategies/Silo/SiloV1Strategy.sol#L188-L191)
```diff
function _totalAssets() internal view override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 shares = collateralToken.balanceOf(address(this));
-   return shares;
-   // return balanceOfUnderlying(shares);
+   return balanceOfUnderlying(shares);
}
```
