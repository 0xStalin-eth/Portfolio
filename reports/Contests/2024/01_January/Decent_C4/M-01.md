# High Severity

## Title
Users can use the protocol freely without paying any fees by calling the `DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload()` function directly.

## Impact
Users can use the protocol without paying any fees.

## The execution flow of `bridgeAndExecute` function

To understand the vulnerability, we need to understand the execution flow of the [`bridgeAndExecute()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L259-L274) function, at least a small portion of it.

When the user wants to bridge tokens of him and execute an action on another chain, he will need to execute the [`UTB::bridgeAndExecute()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L259-L274) function.

Suppose the user exists in Polygon, he has USDC and he wants to mint an NFT in Optimism which costs 1000 DAI. What will happen is that the protocol will first, in polygon, swap the user's USDC with WETH, then bridge the WETH to Optimism, then swap the WETH with DAI and then execute the arbitrary call the user wants to execute, which will be to mint the NFT in exchange for the resulting 1000 DAI from the post-bridge swap operation.

When this function is called, the following will happen:

1. Step 1: When the user calls the [`UTB::bridgeAndExecute()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L259-L274) function, it will do three things: first, it will collect the fees by calling the [`UTBFeeCollector:collectFees()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L228-L251) function, secondly, it will conduct the pre-bridge swap operation (occurs in the source destination), it will swap the user's USDC to WETH. thirdly, it will modify the `swapInstructions` which the user supplied to prepare for the post-bridge swap. Then after all of the 3 operations take place, it will invoke the [`UTB::callBridge()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L282-L301) function.

2. Step 2: In the [`UTB::callBridge()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L282-L301) function, some approvals are granted to the `DecentBridgeAdapter` contract, and then the it will invoke the function [`DecentBridgeAdapter::bridge()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/bridge_adapters/DecentBridgeAdapter.sol#L81-L125) in the `DecentBridgeAdapter` contract.

3. Step 3: In the [`DecentBridgeAdapter::bridge()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/bridge_adapters/DecentBridgeAdapter.sol#L81-L125) function, some data like the post-bridge swap payload and bridge payload (what to execute when the TX reaches destination) will be encoded, then it will reach out to the [`DecentEthRouter`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol) contract and invoke the function [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L197-L215)

4. Step 4: When the execution reaches the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L197-L215) function, an internal function containing the actual logic, with the same name will also be called: [`DecentEthRouter::_bridgeWithPayload`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L148-L194)

    **Note: Notice that the `DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload() function isn't protected by any modifiers, any body can call it directly**

5. Step 5: When the execution gets inside the [`DecentEthRouter::_bridgeWithPayload`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L148-L194) function, the function will prepare the `LzCallParams` for the layerzero call and the actual bridging will happen when the [`dcntEth::sendAndCall`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L185) function is actually invoked.

6. Step 6: The bridging process kickstarts and the execution flow is continued in the destination chain.

## The vulnerability & PoC

The vulnerability is that any user can conduct the pre-bridge swap operation using uniswap by himself, prepare the right calldata and call the function [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L197-L215) directly (since anybody can call it), doing so will allow the user to bypass the fee collection process completely. 

The fee collection as mentioned in the previously detailed execution flow, happens when the user first calls the [`bridgeAndExecute()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTB.sol#L259-L274) function. But as I mentioned, nothing really forces him to start execution from there. All that function does is collect the fees, conduct the pre-bridge swap operation and prepare the proper call data. The user can conduct the pre-bridge swap operation himself, prepare the proper calldata and talk directly to the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L197-L215) function, effecitvely bypassing fee collection.

Anybody can call the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L197-L215) directly, and the protocol has no mechanism of determining whether or not the user is using the protocol with or without paying fees.


## Tools Used
Manual Audit


## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Tighten up the access control on the [`DecentEthRouter::bridgeWithPayload`](https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L197-L215) function, allow only the DecentBridgeAdapter to call the bridgeWithPayload() function.
