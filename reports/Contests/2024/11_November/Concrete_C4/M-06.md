## Title
feeRecipient is charged to pay fees when redeeming shares as opposed to noy paying fees with the withdraw()

## Finding description and impact
### Impact
feeRecipient is charged to pay fees on the redeem() as opposed to not paying fees on the withdraw().

### Finding Description
On the `Vault.withdraw()`, the [feeRecipient is dismissed from paying fees for the withdrawal](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/vault/ConcreteMultiStrategyVault.sol#L400-L402), but, when redeeming shares, the feeRecipient is charged with the withdrawalFee.

```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint256 assets_,
    address receiver_,
    address owner_
) public override nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 shares) {
    ...

    //@audit => The feeRecipient is dismissed from paying withdrawalFee
    // If msg.sender is the withdrawal queue, go straght to the actual withdrawal
    uint256 withdrawalFee = uint256(fees.withdrawalFee);
    uint256 feeShares = msg.sender != feeRecipient
        ? shares.mulDiv(MAX_BASIS_POINTS, MAX_BASIS_POINTS - withdrawalFee, Math.Rounding.Floor) - shares
        : 0;
    shares += feeShares;

    _withdraw(assets_, receiver_, owner_, shares, feeShares);
}

function redeem(
    uint256 shares_,
    address receiver_,
    address owner_
) public override nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 assets) {
    ...

    //@audit-issue => redeem() charges withdrawalFee to the feeRecipient
    uint256 feeShares = shares_.mulDiv(uint256(fees.withdrawalFee), MAX_BASIS_POINTS, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

    assets = _convertToAssets(shares_ - feeShares, Math.Rounding.Floor);

    _withdraw(assets, receiver_, owner_, shares_, feeShares);
}
```

## Proof of Concept
No coded PoC. Detail explanation && code walkthrough on the Finding Description section

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add the same [check of the withdraw()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/vault/ConcreteMultiStrategyVault.sol#L400-L402) to the [redeem()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/vault/ConcreteMultiStrategyVault.sol#L351-L365), in this way, the feeRecipient can redeem all its shares without paying fees.

```diff
function redeem(
    uint256 shares_,
    address receiver_,
    address owner_
) public override nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 assets) {
    if (receiver_ == address(0)) revert InvalidRecipient();
    if (shares_ == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (shares_ > maxRedeem(owner_)) revert MaxError();

-   uint256 feeShares = shares_.mulDiv(uint256(fees.withdrawalFee), MAX_BASIS_POINTS, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
+   uint256 feeShares = msg.sender != feeRecipient
+     ? shares_.mulDiv(uint256(fees.withdrawalFee), MAX_BASIS_POINTS, Math.Rounding.Ceil)
+     : 0;

    assets = _convertToAssets(shares_ - feeShares, Math.Rounding.Floor);

    _withdraw(assets, receiver_, owner_, shares_, feeShares);
}
```
