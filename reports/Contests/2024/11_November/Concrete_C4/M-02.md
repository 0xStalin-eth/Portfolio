## Title
Risk of using stale prices because not validating timestamp returned from the BeraOracle

## Finding description and impact
### Impact
Risk of using stale prices pulled from the BeraOracle.

### Finding Description
Oracles are updated each certain time, and, each time they are updated, their timestamp is updated to reflect the exact time of the last price update.
- **Not setting a threshold that defines by how much time a price update is acceptable poses a risk for the protocol of using old prices for calculations.**

The current implementation of [`OraclePlug._getPriceFromOracle()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/swapper/OraclePlug.sol#L28-L36) only uses the price pulled from the Oracle, it ignores the other two parameters, one of which is the timestamp.
```solidity
function _getPriceFromOracle(
    OracleInformation memory oracle
) internal view returns (uint256 price, uint8 decimals) {
    //@audit-issue => Not checking if the timestamp of the price should be considered stale because it has not been updated for X amount of time.
    // TODO: Maybe also include other Oracle options. Inside the oracle struct there can also be a field for the oracle type.
    // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
    (int256 intPrice, , ) = IBeraOracle(oracle.addr).getPrice(oracle.pair);
    price = SafeCast.toUint256(intPrice);
    decimals = IBeraOracle(oracle.addr).getDecimals(oracle.pair);
}
```

[`IBeraOracle.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/interfaces/IBeraOracle.sol)
```solidity
interface IBeraOracle {
    ...

    //@audit-info => Second parameter returns the timestamp that can be used to validate price staleness
    // Function to get the price of a currency pair. Returns price, timestamp, and another value.
    function getPrice(string calldata pair) external view returns (int256, uint256, uint64);

    ...
}
```

## Proof of Concept
No coded PoC, all details are explained on the Finding Description section.

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Define an acceptable threshold until a price would be considered safe (not stale), and, use the returned timestamp from the bera oracle to validate if it exceeds the defined threshold, if so, reverts, price is stale.
