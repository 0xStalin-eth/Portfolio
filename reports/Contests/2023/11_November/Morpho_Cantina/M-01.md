# Medium Severity

## Title
CompoundV3MigrationBundler is uncapable of withdrawing user's collateral from the Compound's instances

## Impact
- When the CompoundV3MigrationBundler::compoundV3WithdrawFrom() function is called to attempt to withdraw the user's collateral, the whole execution of the multicall transaction will be reverted because a runtime compilation error will occur when the returned value from the Compound::userCollateral() function (a Struct) is tried to be assigned to the balance variable (uint256) [See the Proof of Concept section for more details]

## Proof of Concept

- The CompoundV3MigrationBundler intends to allow users to Migrate positions from CompoundV3 to Morpho Blue, one of the functions that users can use to manage their compound's position and move their assets to Morpho Blue is the [`compoundV3WithdrawFrom() function`](https://cantina.xyz/ai/8409a0ce-6c21-4cc9-8ef2-bd77ce7425af/morpho-blue-bundlers/src/migration/CompoundV3MigrationBundler.sol#L50), which allows users to withdraw their assets from Compound, this function allows users to withdraw the user's collateral that was deposited in Compound, the problem is that the function [`ICompoundV3(instance).userCollateral()`](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/main/contracts/CometStorage.sol#L71-L72) returns a struct, instead of a uint, because of the returned value is a struct, when the value is tried to be assigned to the `balance` variable, a "Type Error" will occur and will revert all the multicall execution, causing users to not being able to migrate their assets from compound to morpho, and also, users would waste their gas paying for a tx that always reverts.

- Let's do a walkthrough of the contracts to spot the exact issue:
> CompoundV3MigrationBundler.sol
```solidity
function compoundV3WithdrawFrom(address instance, address asset, uint256 amount) external payable protected {
    address _initiator = initiator();
    uint256 balance = asset == ICompoundV3(instance).baseToken()
        //@audit-ok => Compound.balanceOf() returns a uint256
        ? ICompoundV3(instance).balanceOf(_initiator)
        
        //@audit-issue => Compund.userCollateral() of the returns a struct, not a uint. 
        //@audit-issue => When trying to assign the returned value to the `balance` variable which is an uint256 it will throw an error about incompatible types
        : ICompoundV3(instance).userCollateral(_initiator, asset);

    amount = Math.min(amount, balance);

    require(amount != 0, ErrorsLib.ZERO_AMOUNT);

    ICompoundV3(instance).withdrawFrom(_initiator, address(this), asset, amount);
}
```

- By looking at the code of the CompoundV3 Protocol, we realize that the call to userColleral() it actually [calls a public mapping defined in the CometStorage.sol](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/main/contracts/CometStorage.sol#L71-L72) (which is a contract that main contract inherits from), and this mapping ends up [returning a Struct](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/main/contracts/CometStorage.sol#L37-L40)
> CompoundV3 Protocol, CometStorage.sol 
```solidity
contract CometStorage {
  ...
  //@audit-info => This is the returned Struct when userCollateral() is called!
  struct UserCollateral {
    uint128 balance;
    uint128 _reserved;
  }
  ...

  //@audit-info => This is the public mapping that is called from the CompoundV3MigrationBundler::compoundV3WithdrawFrom()
  mapping(address => mapping(address => UserCollateral)) public userCollateral;
}
```

- As we've just seen in the previous walkthrough, as a result of not decoding the received struct and just trying to assign it directly to a variable of type uin256, the whole execution will be blown up. All changes will be reverted, causing users to lose all the gas that will be paid for the failed execution.

## Tools Used
Manual Audit, [CompoundV3 Contracts in GitHub](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/main/contracts/Comet.sol) & [CompundV3 Contract Deployed in Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc3d688B66703497DAA19211EEdff47f25384cdc3#readProxyContract#F49)

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- The mitigation for this issue is to make sure to decode the received struct and [assign the value of the variable `balance`](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/main/contracts/CometStorage.sol#L38).
