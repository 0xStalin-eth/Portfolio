## Title
Retiring Strategies leads to funds stuck on the Strategies contracts.

## Finding description and impact
### Impact
When a strategy is retired, the withdrawn funds from the protocol gets stuck on the Strategy contract.

### Finding Description
Strategies can be retired, and, when this happens, the pending rewards are claimed, as well as any pending deposits are withdrawn from the Strategy's protocol (i.e. underlyingAsset is withdrawn from the protocol and pulled into the Strategy's balance).
- **The problem is that all the withdrawn assets from the strategy's protocol are left on the Strategy**, which causes those assets to get stuck on the Strategy contract.

## Proof of Concept
See the `retireStrategy()` for [AaveV3](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/strategies/Aave/AaveV3Strategy.sol#L111-L114), RadiantV2, CompoundV3, Morpho, and, SiloV1 Strategies, they all just **withdraw any leftover deposits from the protocol, but, none of the withdrawn underlyingAssets are transferred to the Vault.**

**[`AaveV3Strategy.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/strategies/Aave/AaveV3Strategy.sol)**
```solidity
function retireStrategy() external onlyOwner {
    _handleRewardsOnWithdraw();
    _protocolWithdraw(aToken.balanceOf(address(this)), 0);
    //@audit-issue => The withdrawn underlying is left on the Strategy contract.
}

//@audit => Withdraws underlying from the AavePool into the Strategy contract itself
function _protocolWithdraw(uint256 assets_, uint256) internal virtual override {
    //slither-disable-next-line unused-return
    lendingPool.withdraw(asset(), assets_, address(this));
}
```

All the underlyingAssets that are left on the Strategy's balance will be irrecoverable. Calls to the Strategy `withdraw()` or `redeem()` functions will revert because the [`StrategyBase._withdraw()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/strategies/StrategyBase.sol#L155-L172) will attempt to withdraw the assets from the pool associated to the strategy, the problem is, at this point, the Strategy has no longer any assets deposited on the pool, all the underlyingAssets are sitting on the Strategy's balance.
**[`StrategyBase._withdraw()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-concrete/blob/main/src/strategies/StrategyBase.sol#L155-L172)**
```solidity
function _withdraw(
    address caller_,
    address receiver_,
    address owner_,
    uint256 assets_,
    uint256 shares_
) internal virtual override(ERC4626Upgradeable) whenNotPaused onlyVault {
    //slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
    if (shares_ == 0 || assets_ == 0) revert ZeroAmount();

    //@audit => After a strategy is retired, the Strategy has no longer any deposits on the underlying protocol, therefore, attempting to withdraw the assets from it will revert the entire tx
    _protocolWithdraw(assets_, shares_);

    ...
}
```

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
After withdrawing from the protocol, transfer all the underlyingAsset balance held by the strategy to the Vault.
- In this way, all the assets of the remaining deposits on the Strategy will still be owned by the Vault, once in the Vault, they can be deployed to a different strategy, or it can be used as liquidity to process withdrawals.

```diff
function retireStrategy() external onlyOwner {
    _handleRewardsOnWithdraw();
    _protocolWithdraw(aToken.balanceOf(address(this)), 0);
+   IERC20(asset()).safeTransfer(_vault, IERC20(asset().balanceOf(address(this))));
}
```
