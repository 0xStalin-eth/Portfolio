# High Severity

## Title
Borrowers won't be able to update the state.maxTotalSupply because the setMaxTotalSupply() is uncallable

## Impact
- When the original maxTotalSupply is reached, the market won't be able to receive more deposits because the maxTotalSupply can't be updated.

## Proof of Concept
- The [`WildcatMarketConfig::setMaxTotalSupply()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/market/WildcatMarketConfig.sol#L134-L144) is restricted to be called only by the controller, it has implemented the [`onlyController` modifier](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/market/WildcatMarketBase.sol#L136-L139), which enforces the caller to be the Controller contract. The problem is that in the [`WildcatMarketController` contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatMarketController.sol) there is not a single reference that calls the setMaxTotalSupply(), thus, the borrowers won't be able to update the original value that was set for the maxTotalSupply variable.
    - As we can see in the below code, the setMaxTotalSupply() is only callable by the controller.

> WildcatMarketBase contract
```solidity
  modifier onlyController() {
    //@audit-info => If caller is not the controller contract, the tx is reverted!
    if (msg.sender != controller) revert NotController();
    _;
  }
```

> WildcatMarketConfig contract
```solidity
  //@audit-info => onlyController modifier enforces that the only allowed caller is the Controller contract
  function setMaxTotalSupply(uint256 _maxTotalSupply) external onlyController nonReentrant {
    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();
    if (_maxTotalSupply < state.totalSupply()) {
      revert NewMaxSupplyTooLow();
    }

    state.maxTotalSupply = _maxTotalSupply.toUint128();
    _writeState(state);
    emit MaxTotalSupplyUpdated(_maxTotalSupply);
  }
```

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Make sure to create a function in the Controller contract that runs the proper validations and will end up calling the setMaxTotalSupply(), in this way, the borrowers will be able to update the state.maxTotalSupply if it's required.
