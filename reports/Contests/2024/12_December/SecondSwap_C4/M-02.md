## Title
Not possible to remove a supported coin for payments

## Finding description and impact
### Impact
In the case that a supported PaymentToken goes down in value, there is no way to remove it as a valid PaymentToken.
- Arbitrers can take advantage of this event to purchase the VestedTokens at a big discount, before the Sellers are able to delist their Orders from the Marketplace.
- Admins could freeze the Marketplace, but, this would impact all the trades, not only the trades involving the PaymentToken with problems.
All these things considered, a medium severity seems acceptable since the only action that can be taken by the admins would impact all the MarketPlace, not only the Orders that use the bad PaymentToken.

### Finding Description
Marketplace's [admin can add different Tokens as accepted PaymentTokens.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-12-secondswap/blob/main/contracts/SecondSwap_Marketplace.sol#L205-L218) The problem is that once a PaymentToken has been marked as accepted, it is not possible to mark it as non accepted again.
- This can cause unexpected outcomes when any of the accepted PaymentTokens experiences problems with their market value. We have seen in the past big stablished stablecoins having considerable problems, for example, USDC crashing 30%.

As detailed on the Impact section, there is not a way to protect sellers using a PaymentToken who is having problems, the only available workaround would be to freeze the market, but this would freeze the entire marketplace, including orders using other PaymentTokens who are not having problems.

## Proof of Concept
No need of a coded PoC, all the details are on the Impact and Finding Description Sections.

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add a function to allow the admins to remove a PaymentToken as a supported coin on the Marketplace.
- In this way, in case something happens to an accepted PaymentToken, the admins can simply remove it and all the orders accepting such a PaymentToken will revert, this allows the Sellers to delist those orders with that PaymentToken, and, re-list using a different PaymentToken.
