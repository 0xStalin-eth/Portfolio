# High Severity

## Title
Anybody can update the address of the curves contract in the FeeSplitter contract

## Impact
Updating the address of the Curves contract to any other contract will allow attackers to point to a contract where they can inflate the balances and total supply so they can steal all the fees that have been transferred into the FeeSplitter.


## Proof of Concept
The [`FeeSplitter::setCurves() function`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-curves/blob/main/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L35-L37) doesn't have any control access, it allows anybody to pass any address and set it as the address of the Curves contract.

> FeeSplitter.sol
```solidity
//@audit-issue => No restrictions as to who can call this function
function setCurves(Curves curves_) public {
    curves = curves_;
}
```

- The address that the curves variable points to is of utmost importance for the correct computations when calculating the balance and totalSupply when users claims their fee, if an attacker can control the address that the curves variables point to, attackers can easily drain all the fees by pointing the curves variable to a contract that will returns a huge number as if the attacker would own a huge amount of curvesTokens.

> FeeSplitter.sol
```solidity
    function balanceOf(address token, address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        //@audit-issue => If the curves variable points to a contract controlled by an attacker, it can easily return a huge number when calling a function called `curvesTokenBalance()`
        return curves.curvesTokenBalance(token, account) * PRECISION;
    }

    function totalSupply(address token) public view returns (uint256) {
        //@dev: this is the amount of tokens that are not locked in the contract. The locked tokens are in the ERC20 contract
        //@audit-issue => Attackers having control over the address that the curves variable points to allows them to manipulate the values returned from the `curvesTokenSupply() & curvesTokenBalance() functions`
        return (curves.curvesTokenSupply(token) - curves.curvesTokenBalance(token, address(curves))) * PRECISION;
    }
```

- Just as an example, an attacker can easily deploy a contract like this one that would allow him to steal all the gas from the FeeSplitter contract
> AttackerContract.sol
```solidity
contract Curves {
  ...

  //@audit-info => If the account is other than the attacker's account, return 0, as if anybody would own 0 curvesTokens
  //@audit-info => If the account is the attacker's account, return a huge number, as if the attacker would own a huge amount of curvesTokens.
  function curvesTokenBalance(address token, address account) returns (uint256) {
    if(account != attackerAddress) return 0;
    return type(uint256).max;
  }

  ...

}
```

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Add an AccessControl, allowing only the owner or the manager to update the address of the curves contract
