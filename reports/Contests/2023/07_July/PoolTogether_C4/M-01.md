# Medium Severity

# Result
Duplicate of #351 ===> Delegated amounts can be forcefully removed from anyone in the TwabController

## Title
Anybody can forcefully set the SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS to be a delegate of anybody else, and all the delegateBalance will be transferred from the current delegate to the SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS

## Impact
- All the delegate_balance of anybody can be delegated to the SPONSORHIP_ADDRESS which will make that the [delegator account revokes their chances to win](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-twab-controller/blob/0145eeac23301ee5338c659422dd6d69234f5d50/src/TwabController.sol#L23C3-L24)

## Proof of Concept
- When calling the [`Vault::sponsor()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L480-L482) if the SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS is not a delegate of the _receive address, it will [make a call to the `TwabController::sponsor()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L988) and forward the address of the `_receiver` account as the address of the account that will delegate its delegateBalance to the SPONSORHIP_ADDRESS
  - In the [`TwabController:sponsor()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-twab-controller/blob/0145eeac23301ee5338c659422dd6d69234f5d50/src/TwabController.sol#L500-L502) it calls the [`_delegate()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-twab-controller/blob/0145eeac23301ee5338c659422dd6d69234f5d50/src/TwabController.sol#L648-L664) to [transfer the delegatebalance of the current delegate of the `_receiver` account to the SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-twab-controller/blob/0145eeac23301ee5338c659422dd6d69234f5d50/src/TwabController.sol#L612-L639)  

- The attack costs as low as 1 wei of the underlying asset of the Vault, and the result is forcing the `_receiver` address (which can be any address of the users using the vault) to revoke their chances to win.

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Validate if `_receiver` is the `msg.sender`.
  - Do not allow that anybody can delegate the balance of other users to the SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS

```solidity
  function _sponsor(uint256 _assets, address _receiver) internal returns (uint256) {
    uint256 _shares = deposit(_assets, _receiver);

    if (
      _twabController.delegateOf(address(this), _receiver) != _twabController.SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS()
    ) {
+     require(msg.sender == _receiver, "Error, cant delegate other users' balance to the SPONSORSHIP_ADRESS");     
      _twabController.sponsor(_receiver);
    }

    emit Sponsor(msg.sender, _receiver, _assets, _shares);

    return _shares;
  }
```
