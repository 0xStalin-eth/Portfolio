# High Severity

## Title
Normalizing decimals to 18 decimals returns the amount scaled up by a magnitude different than 18 when the original tokenDecimals are not 18 decimals

## Impact
- Incorrectly computing the magnitude of the token amounts will make that users transfer more tokens than what they really expect to transfer
- Also is possible that for a good number of users it becomes impossible to even cover the wrong computed amount of tokens, thus, they won't be able to use the systems
- Also using an incorrect magnitude can impact the internal accounting and balances in the system, which could lead to losses or even DoS in functions dependant on the internal accounting & balances.

## Proof of Concept
- The [current formula to normalize the decimals](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/main/src/ulysses-omnichain/BranchBridgeAgent.sol#L1335-L1342) is the below one:
```solidity
function _normalizeDecimals(uint256 _amount, uint8 _decimals) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return _decimals == 18 ? _amount : _amount * (10 ** _decimals) / 1 ether;
}
```

- By doing the math we have:
```
```
  - Example 1: **A token that has 8 decimals**:
      - `_amount` is scaled up by the tokensDecimals!
        - The formula:         `_amount * (10 ** _decimals) / 1 ether`
        - Substituting values: `[(10**8) * (10**8)] / (10**18)` ===> `(10**16) / (10**18)` ===> `10**-2`
        - result:              This doesnt even compile in solidity, it will throw an error as follows: 
          - **TypeError: Return argument type rational_const 1 / 100 is not implicitly convertible to expected type (type of first return variable) uint256.**  
```
```
  - Example 2: **A token that has 30 decimals**:
      - `_amount` is scaled up by the tokensDecimals!

        - The formula:         `_amount * (10 ** _decimals) / 1 ether`
        - Substituting values: `[(10**30) * (10**30)] / (10**18)` ===> `(10**60) / (10**18)` ===> `10**42`
        - result:              `10**42`
```
```
- As demonstrated in the above examples, the current formula doesn't compute correctly the normalization of the decimals to 18 decimals.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Make sure to update the formula to normalize the decimals to 18 as follows:
```solidity
function _normalizeDecimals(uint256 _amount, uint8 _decimals) internal pure returns (uint256) {
-   return _decimals == 18 ? _amount : _amount * (10 ** _decimals) / 1 ether;
+   return _decimals == 18 ? _amount : _amount * 1 ether / (10 ** _decimals);
}
```

- By doing the math we have:
```
```
  - Example 1: A token that has 8 decimals:
      - `_amount` is scaled up by the tokensDecimals!

      - The formula:         `_amount * 1 ether / (10 ** _decimals)`
      - Substituting values: `[(10**8) * (10**18)] / (10**8)` ===> `(10**26) / (10**8)` ===> `10**18`
      - result:              `10**18`
```
```
  - Example 2: A token that has 30 decimals:
      - `_amount` is scaled up by the tokensDecimals!

      - The formula:         `_amount * 1 ether / (10 ** _decimals)`
      - Substituting values: `[(10**30) * (10**18)] / (10**30)` ===> `(10**48) / (10**30)` ===> `10**18`
      - result:              `10**18`
