# High Severity

## Title
Anybody can call the RngRelayAuction::rngComplete() function and send data at will to manipulate the result of the draw

## Impact
- Users can manipulate the result of the draw by calling the [`RngRelayAuction::rngComplete()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-draw-auction/blob/f1c6d14a1772d6609de1870f8713fb79977d51c1/src/RngRelayAuction.sol#L125-L176) function and sending data at their convenience 

## Proof of Concept
- The [`RngRelayAuction::rngComplete()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-draw-auction/blob/f1c6d14a1772d6609de1870f8713fb79977d51c1/src/RngRelayAuction.sol#L125-L176) is on charge of closing the draw in the PrizePool as well as withdrawing the reserve and send it to the rewardRecipient.
- **All the data that should be used to execute the `rngComplete()` function should be computed by the relayer**, this function forwards the computed data from the relayer onto the PrizePool.

- **The problem is that this function has no access control**, there is any check to validate if the caller is the relayer, which means that **anybody can call this function and set the parameters at their convenience**, which will lead to close draws using values that could benefit the caller and all the rest of users will be impacted because the randomNumber is now manipulated at the convenience of whoever calls first the `rngComplete()`.

## Tools Used
Manual Audit

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
- Add an Access Control Mechanism to ensure that only the authorized relayer can call the [`RngRelayAuction::rngComplete()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-draw-auction/blob/f1c6d14a1772d6609de1870f8713fb79977d51c1/src/RngRelayAuction.sol#L125-L176)
- Use the [`rngAuctionRelayer` variable which as stated by the comments in the code](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-draw-auction/blob/f1c6d14a1772d6609de1870f8713fb79977d51c1/src/RngRelayAuction.sol#L77-L79), this variable stores the address of the relayer that RNG results must originate from.

function rngComplete(
  ...
) external returns (bytes32) {
+ require(msg.sender == rngAuctionRelayer, "Caller is not the authorized relayer");
